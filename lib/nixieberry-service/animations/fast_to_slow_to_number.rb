  #  Ah, yes. I should have known. It's basically duty cycle=sqrt(2)^x except scaled so that it gives the right domain for whatever range you want to use. (in this case scaled by about 1.408 or 255/sqrt(2)^16. You could use the form PWM=(range/sqrt(2)^domain)*sqrt(2)^x simplified PWM = range* 2^((x-domain)/2) I think for now I'll just calculate data for a larger domain and use that. I could have it calculate in real time, but look-up tables are faster and I already have it implemented. Thank you!

    #back to start value...
